# GameDev

This repo stores different projects that I've done with Unity and C#.

These are relatively simple games with a lot going behind the scenes.

I did not use any Unity assets that would facilitate the game development.

For instance, I didn't use the built-in physics until I manually coded my own gravity, movement, and collision resolution.

Game development is fairly complex if you write your own algorithms for everything and care for efficiency rather than using pre-existing assets that will do that for you.
