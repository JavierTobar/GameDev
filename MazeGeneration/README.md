# Summary

3D FPS game played with WASD/mouse controller for motion and looking around.

You are spawned at 1 corner of the map and there will be random path generated from spawn location to a canyon in the middle of the map.

Along this generated path, there are several to collect which are needed to destroy part of the maze solution at the end to win the game.

You have to jump around the maze one platform at a time and get to the other side in order to win the game. 

If you run out of bullets and don't destroy part of the maze solution or if you fall into the canyon, you lose. 


### This projects highlights random 3D maze generation, path generation from spawn to the start of the maze and being able to recognize the maze solution.
